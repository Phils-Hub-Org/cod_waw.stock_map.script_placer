# cod_waw.stock.map_script_placer

Creates a mod with the relevant decompiled stock map files.

## Installation

Place the executable in your call of duty: world at war folder.

## Usage

Run exe, input a mod name, select a map, click submit.

When submitting a mod for the very first time, you will see a message informing you that it cant locate a dir..
All you need to do is navigate to 'waw_root_dir\Phils-Hub\Stock-Map Script-Placer' and place the 'Stock Base Files' folder there.
Doing it this way prevents you from having to create said dir yourself since the tool will create it for you upon mod creation.
